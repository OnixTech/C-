This C++ application calculates the total price of shares based on
compound investment. It leverages object-oriented programming
principles, including classes and objects, to organize the code into
manageable units and encapsulate related functionality.

## Key Features:

- **Compound Investment Calculation:** Allows users to calculate the
total price of shares over time using compound investment. Considers
factors such as the initial share price, monthly investments, total
investment period, and monthly interest rate.

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Employs object-oriented design principles
to structure the code. Utilizes classes to represent the investment
plan and encapsulate related data and functionality. Objects of these
classes are instantiated to perform calculations and manage investment
parameters.

- **Templates:** Utilizes templates to create generic functions, such
as the menu input function (menu_in), which can operate on different
data types. Enhances code reusability and flexibility, allowing the
application to handle various input types seamlessly.

- **Flow Control:** Utilizes flow control constructs, including switch
statements and loops, to manage program flow and decision-making. For
example, a switch statement is employed to navigate through different
stages of the investment plan input process.

- **Pointers:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the application may
leverage pointers internally for various purposes, such as managing
dynamic memory allocation or accessing class member functions and
variables.
